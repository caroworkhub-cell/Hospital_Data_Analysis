# Hospital_Data_Analysis
## Project Overview
A powerBI report on Hospital Data
## Dataset 
Patients, Pharmacy_transactions, Visits
## Tools
PowerBI,DAX,Power Query
## Changes
I checked for duplicates, removed unnecessary columns like the Patient name column and checked for blanks.
I later used calculated the KPIs eg. total revenue then created the charts.
For the age group I grouped the ages into various groups eg; youth, young adult, elderly etc.

## Key Insights
1.Pneumonia and Malaria appear to be the most common diseases across the counties, according to the bar chart they appear in most counties.
2. A higher number of patient visits almost always leads to higher pharmacy revenues. According to the scatter chart the dots tend to be moving upwards apart from two outliers.
3. The Inpatient Department tends to generate the highest pharmacy revenue as seen in the bar chart as it's leading with a total cost of 96K.
4. The elderly tend to consume the most medication when compared to other age groups as seen in the donut chart.
5. Most diagnosis associated with longer hospital stays tend to have higher spending as seen in the table that compares diagnosis, length of stay days and total cost.
## Recommendations
-Typhoid prevention programmes should be introduced in Kiambu.
